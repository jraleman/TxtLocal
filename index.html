## Chapter 1 - What do I do?

> Hello everyone, concerned Christian Father here.
> Recently my 11 year old son downloaded the video game Fortnite after playing it at a friend’s house.
> While I didn’t mind it at first, it soon began affect his character.
> Within a week he had taken up semi-pro Fortnite dancing competitions.
> When asked to do his homework, he called me a “default” and did a strange pose with his arms extended outwards.
> His grades have been dropping heavily ever since that day and when I confront him about it he threatens to “one pump” me.
> He refuses to eat his favourite foods anymore and constantly demands a “chug jug”.
> Now he has dyed his hair the colour blue as a way to “promote” his idol “Ninja” and refers to me and my wife as “little craps”.
> I try to get him to go to bible studies now but he just tells me to jump out of the “battle bus” without a glider.

> **Please help!!!**
